Solutions to data structures and algorithm problems

## Day 1
> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Day 2
>1. There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
>2. Longest Common Subsequence using DP.
>3. Longest UnCommon Subsequence

### Day 3
>1. Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

## Day 4
>1. Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

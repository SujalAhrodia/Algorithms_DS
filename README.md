Solutions to data structures and algorithm problems

## Day 1
> Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Day 2
>1. There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
>2. Longest Common Subsequence using DP.
>3. Longest UnCommon Subsequence

### Day 3
>1. Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

## Day 4
>1. Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.
>2. Since the problem desciption is long, you can find it [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-ip-address/)

## Day 5
>1. You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value. Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.
>2. Find the sum of all the leaves in a given binary tree.
>3. Find the sum of all the left leaves in a given binary tree.
>4. Find the sum of all the right leaves in a given binary tree.
>5. Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Day 6
>1. Given an array of ages of people, find the total number of friend requests possible to be send according to a given criteria.

## Day 7
>1. You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.
A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)
Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 
You may return the answer in any order.

## Day 8 
>1. Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

## Day 9
>1. Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

## Day 10
>1. You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.
Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.
